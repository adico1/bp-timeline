##Setup
#####Client

1. Navigate to your client folder: `cd {project folder}/client`
2. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run your dev server. `npm run serve`. Your dev server is ready at http://localhost:8080
   (The dev server defaults to port 8080. If it's taken and it uses a different one you'll need to update your cors settings in the server app.js)

#####Server

1. Navigate to your server folder: `cd {project folder}/server`
2. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run your server. `DEBUG=server:\* npm start`. Your server is ready at http://localhost:3000
